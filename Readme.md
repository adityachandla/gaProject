# Geometric algorithms project

## Instructions for running 
For macOS or linux:
1. Make sure you have Java 17 and maven installed
2. You should be able to run the project by running
```./runner.sh```. If you are using intelliJ, then you need to run Main
with the path to the source folder as the first argument and the path to 
the output folder as the second argument.

### Utilities
1. main.py is an ad-hoc script that plots lines and polygons.
2. Converter.java is a script that converts a file from geogebra format to
test input format.
